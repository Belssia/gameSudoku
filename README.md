# Sudoku game

The purpose of this Python challenge is to demonstrate the use of a backtracking algorithm to solve a Sudoku puzzle,
The objective of a Sudoku puzzle is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
A Sudoku puzzle is a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

***Backtracking algorithm***

A backtracking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that attempts to solve a given problem by testing all possible paths towards a solution until a solution is found. Each time a path is tested, if a solution is not found, the algorithm backtracks to test another possible path and so on till a solution is found or all paths have been tested.
The typical scenario where a backtracking algorithm is when you try to find your way out in a maze. Every time you reach a dead-end, you backtrack to try another path untill you find the exit or all path have been explored.
Backtracking algorithms rely on the use of a recursive function.
